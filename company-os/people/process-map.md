# Process map

Every process in the company, one owner, one backup, its cadence and where it is documented. A global counterpart can trace any activity to a person. Owners confirmed by André Silva on 19 Sep 2026; "Open" marks a process still without one. Titles: see `README.md`. Sheila Esmeralda is on leave and outside the project. Tactical work she owned runs through the backup until she returns.

## How to use this map

- A process with no owner is a blocker in the next weekly pulse until it has one.
- When a person is away, the backup runs the process and says so in the group of that process.
- A new process is added here the day it starts, with owner and backup, before anything else is written about it.
