## Partner signup pipeline and metrics (owner: Abner Maioralli, Head of Partner Enablement; P33)

Scope: every new acquirer directly connected to the central bank of its country, and every on-ramp desk, from first contact to first live transaction. Abner produces the integration, whatever it takes, and reports these numbers in the weekly pulse.

| Acquirer or desk | Country | Stage (contact / requirements / documents sent / contract / credentials / integration / test / live) | First contact | Contract signed | First live transaction | Open requirements (count, oldest age) | First-30-days approval rate | All-in cost vs acceptance criterion | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cielo | Brazil | requirements | Open | | | Open | | | Abner Maioralli |
| Asaas | Brazil | requirements | Open | | | Open | | | Abner Maioralli |
| EFI | Brazil | requirements | Open | | | Open | | | Abner Maioralli |
| On-ramp desk 1: MIPPO/GFS/OrbiFi | Brazil | contract (MIPPO addendum) | | GFS 30 Jul 2025 | | MIPPO addendum; GFS successor | — | bps vs PTAX | Abner Maioralli with Taina Chaves |
| On-ramp desk 2: Transfero | Brazil | restart (PSAV + A55 wallet) | | | | PSAV protocol; wallet questionnaire | — | bps vs PTAX | Abner Maioralli with Taina Chaves |

Metrics Abner owns: acquirers in pipeline, in signup, live; days from first contact to signed contract; days from signed contract to first live transaction; open requirements per acquirer and their age; first-30-days approval rate and all-in cost of each new rail against the acceptance criterion; share of volume on rails signed in the last twelve months. Targets: Cielo, Asaas and EFI signed by 1 Oct 2026 (account-open); first own-MID transaction when the slowest of the three is live.
